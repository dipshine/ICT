 > I can <b>manage</b> content using established workflows in Week 9. 
 > * This week, we had a lot of things to complete. As usual, we assigned tasks through planner. We check marked whatever we completed so far that way, it helped everyone know how we are doing and what needs to be re-done.

 > I can <b>identify and employ</b> technologies related to content management in Week 9.
 > * This week, I basically learned to multitask. With being developer on one side, writing the content for my walkthrough, coding the weekly blog post on the other side, I knew what I want and how I was going to do it.
 >
 >  I can <b>find and use</b> resources for self-directed learning. 
 > * For this, I searched different "how to" videos on YouTube. I tried it, I failed, I retried it, went to different blogs related to WordPress. Overall, it was a fun-learning experience.
