 > * I can identify and define key concepts in ***(web) content management.*** We were introduced with WordPress and basic ideas with what it offers.
 >
 > * I can describe and compare content management systems in Week 6. I explored WordPress and it is quiet better as we don't have to deal with creating files/folder but I learnt a lot in Hugo so would like to stick with both.
 >
 > * I can manage content using established workflows in Week 6. For our first group blog post, we created our plan how we were going to create content, edit it, add markups, and meet deadlines. Creating workflow document is the wisest decision as a group to make things go smoother.
 >
 > * I can identify and employ technologies related to content management in Week 6. I learned and explored how I can use the WordPress resources.
 >
 > * I can find and use resources for self-directed learning. For this, I went to Youtube and searched how people use WordPress and how they get the most out of it.
