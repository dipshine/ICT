 >  I can **identify and define** key concepts in ***(web) content management.*** 
 > * This week, I learned what content modeling is. I understood that all the small attributes come together to form a content model.
 >
 >  I can **describe and compare** content management systems in Week 10. 
 > * This week, I learned the difference between open and close content management. The main difference between them is that the open cms can be modified by anyone whereas close cms cannot be seen and modified by anyone.
 >
 > I can **manage** content using established workflows in Week 10. 
 > * This week, like every week, our group created our workflow through planner and assigned our roles. Everyone worked for their assigned tasks as per their leisure time and planned to submit the project before the deadline.
 >
 > I can **identify and employ** technologies related to content management in Week 10.
 > * I now can differentiate the content modeling on WordPress and Hugo and will select the cms as per my needs. 
 >
 >  I can **find and use** resources for self-directed learning. 
 > * Compared to other weeks, we only had few readings this week. The only resource I used this week was the course readings.
